## Introduction

This project is a culmination of the React knowledge acquired during the Frontend Developer Program  
at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, applied to create a fully functional eCom store.  
As well as knowledge I have acquired from other sources like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).
