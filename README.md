## Introduction

This is a school project from Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.  
More specifically the JavaScript Frameworks - Course Assignment.  
From my second (and last) year of their Frontend Developer Program.
This project is a culmination of the React knowledge acquired during the course, applied to create a fully functional eCom store.  
As well as knowledge I have acquired from other sources like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).
